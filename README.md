Object-oriented programming practice (2nd year Computer Engineering (BEng)

lab1: Classes usage: Develop a hierarchy with at least 2 classes for working with text data (array of strings) consisting of:
a) a base class that contains: two constructors, a destructor, a function for determining the length of the text, a function for determining the number of lines in the text, a function for determining the number of words in the text, a function for determining the number of spaces in the text, a function for removing extra spaces from the text.
b) a derived class that contains a member method of the derived class for determining the number of words in the given text.


lab2.1: 1) Develop a class structure for working with dynamic arrays, which must include at least 2 class member data and 5 class methods, of which there must be a class member method for:
- creating an array;
- filling an array;
- displaying the contents of the array on the screen;
- clearing memory.
2) Develop a class member method for descending sorting
by the bubble method of a one-dimensional dynamic array. 

lab2_2: 1) Develop a class structure for working with two-dimensional arrays, which must include at least 3 class member data and 5 class methods, of which there must be a class member method for:
- creating an array;
- filling an array;
- displaying the contents of the array on the screen;
- clearing memory.
2) Develop a class member method to create a new one-dimensional array with the arithmetic mean of all positive elements of each column of a given two-dimensional dynamic array.

lab2_3:  Supplement the class for working with one-dimensional dynamic arrays from task 2 with a function for determining the square root of a given member and a subroutine that uses this function to transform each even element of a one-dimensional dynamic array.

lab3_1: Develop a class member method for writing a line into a text file.

lab3_2: Develop a class member method to copy a given amount of data from a given position in a binary file.

lab4: overload the following operations:
+ + − add an element to the stack;
− − remove an element from the stack;
bool() − check if the stack is empty
